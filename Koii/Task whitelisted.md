## How to Whitelist Your Task

To get your task whitelisted, follow these steps:

1. **Test Locally**: Begin by testing your task on your local environment to ensure it functions correctly. 

2. **Test with Friends (Advanced Task)**:  share it with friends for further testing and feedback.

3. **Use the Advanced Task Feature**: Before applying for the whitelisting process, utilize the Advanced Task feature on the node. This allows you to run your own task without official whitelisting, enabling your friends to run it as well.

4. **Apply for Whitelisting**: To have your task appear on the whitelisted tasks list, take the following actions:
    - Make your repository **public** or share it directly with the Koii team.
    - Open a **support ticket on Discord** to initiate the whitelisting process.

### Optional Step

- **Create a GitHub Account**: For the task reviewing process, it's recommended to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. This facilitates easier sharing and review of your task by the Koii team and others.

Remember, opening a support ticket on Discord is crucial for the whitelisting process. Make sure to follow these guidelines carefully to ensure your task can be shared and utilized by the wider community.
