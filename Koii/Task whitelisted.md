## How to Whitelist Your Task

To get your task whitelisted, follow these steps:

### Use the Advanced Task Feature
Before applying for the whitelisting process, utilize the Advanced Task feature on the node. This allows you to run your own task without official whitelisting, enabling your friends to run it as well. You can find the advanced task feature under **Add Task > + Advanced**. 

### 1. Test Locally
Begin by testing your task on your local environment to ensure it functions correctly. 

### 2. Test with Friends
Click on **Add Task > + Advanced** to add your task to the list, then share it with friends for further testing and feedback. 

### 3. Apply for Whitelisting
To have your task appear on the whitelisted tasks list, take the following actions:
  - Make your repository **public** or share it directly with the Koii team.
  - Open a **support ticket on Discord** to initiate the whitelisting process. 

### Note
During this process, our team will create a dedicated GitHub account for holding your project.
