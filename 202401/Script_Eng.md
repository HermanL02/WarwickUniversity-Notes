# The Deliberation on End-to-End Encryption: Privacy or Security

# Title

Hello everyone, I am Herman. Today, our topic is about the privacy and security issues of E2EE (End-to-End Encryption).

# Introduction and Motivation

Frankly speaking, end-to-end encryption is not a new concept; it has been in use on WhatsApp since 2014. The reason I chose this topic is that, in recent years, we have seen an increasing number of legislations worldwide. So, in the foreseeable future, discussions on E2EE are expected to continue and intensify. Governments often justify their stance on E2EE for security reasons, either national security or the safety from crimes. They argue that end-to-end encryption facilitates the increase of terrorist organizations and child pornography, leading governments to seek ways to weaken or prohibit E2EE. On the other hand, privacy advocates support E2EE, believing it ensures online users' protection from threats by service providers, government agencies, and other cyber actors. Countries like those in the Five Eyes Alliance, many EU countries, and China support legislations to weaken E2EE. However, some governments, like Germany, express opposition to restrictions on E2EE, as do some privacy advocates. Additionally, companies join the opposition to retain users and prevent user loss.

Each country continues to express its viewpoint on this issue, and the discussions are ongoing. However, I believe a final decision will soon be reached, which is why I wish to discuss this topic today.

# More Precise

To sum up, I believe this issue is a sub issue of a larger problem. Whether the government should be allowed to prevent end-to-end encryption is asking if we should grant the government access to our personal chat records, including scanning and direct viewing.

# Table of Contents

Today's discussion will cover several parts:

1. Introduction to E2EE.
2. The government's perspective and why they insist on implementing anti-E2EE legislations, including actions they have already taken.
3. Reasons why we should continue supporting E2EE, including opinions from citizens and companies.
4. My personal viewpoint.
5. Audience questions.

# Part 1: E2EE

## Brief: What is E2EE?

Simply put, end-to-end encryption is a method of communication where only the sender and receiver can view messages. This means that no third party, including communication service providers, telecom providers, ISPs, or anyone else seeking access to chat logs, can access these messages. Many messaging services use E2EE, including iMessage, WhatsApp, and Zoom.

# Part 2: Government View

## EU

### Proposal on Child Sex Abuse Regulation (CSAR)

This legislation, proposed in 2022, is a new EU regulation. Its proponents believe voluntary actions by online service providers to monitor online child sexual abuse are insufficient, necessitating government involvement. One aspect of this regulation mandates compulsory chat control on all digital private communications, clearly impacting E2EE. However, this proposal was not passed.

### Spain's Approach to E2EE

Spain leads within the EU in limiting millions of people's encryption, citing the prevention of child sexual abuse content. However, this could jeopardize E2EE. Denmark and Ireland support scanning to protect encryption, but experts believe this is technically impossible.

## US

Section 230(e)(1) allows federal prosecutors to hold service providers accountable for CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) in their services (even if state prosecutors and civil plaintiffs cannot). If enacted, this would put immense legal pressure on internet companies of all sizes to stop using true E2EE, thus scanning all user information, photos, and files. This bill initially failed to pass in 2020, was reintroduced in 2022, and again in 2023, and will continue to be a topic of discussion.

## UK

This legislation requires platforms to filter legal but harmful or illegal content, including scanning child pornography content in platforms using E2EE, despite expert warnings that such scanning mechanisms cannot be achieved without compromising user privacy. Like the US bill, it's deemed unfeasible. However, it retains significant government power to limit E2EE in the future. The government has published articles on why they are interested in citizens' chat records, citing examples like the 830,000 individuals in the UK potentially threatening children online or in person. Investigations into child sexual abuse in the UK have identified 27 million images. Child abuse searches exceed 400,000 monthly. They argue that E2EE will enable social media companies to ignore child sexual abuse material repeatedly shared on their platforms.

## China

Xi Jinping has stated that without cybersecurity, there is no national security. The Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China, effective from June 1, 2017, Article 21, states, "Technical measures to monitor and record network operation status and network security incidents shall be taken, and relevant network logs shall be retained for no less than six months." This indicates that logs containing personal information must be kept for at least six months. These legislations aim to prevent crime and protect citizens' safety, appearing to be on the right track, but are we missing something?

# Why Not? Arguments Against Restricting E2EE

## History: PRISM - Surveillance Programs

- Edward Snowden revealed programs such as XKeyscore used by the US for global surveillance, including emails, chats, videos, photos, file transfers, and social network details.
- Tempora, used by the UK's GCHQ, reportedly collects data indiscriminately from both public citizens and targeted suspects, including phone recordings, email content, Facebook entries, and individual internet histories. German Federal Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called the program a "nightmare," likening it to George Orwell's 1984.
- ECHELON: Five Eye Nations These events revealed government spy programs collecting data both domestically and internationally. The programs' existence sparked inherent distrust in governments, clearly showing they did not adhere to using the information solely for security purposes.

## History: Censorship and Privacy in China

- Blocking News: Gaoli Zhang Sexual Assault Case
- Control over Messaging Platforms China frequently monitors messages on WeChat, including images and text, especially during special periods. For instance, during Peng Shuai's accusation of sexual assault against Zhang Gaoli, a top-ranking Chinese official, all related messages were censored on Weibo within half an hour, and it was impossible to send corresponding messages on WeChat, even in private chats. Thus, non-E2EE communications were used not just as a tool against crime but also to limit freedom of speech. The Chinese official media did not debunk these events, suggesting their veracity but with restricted widespread dissemination.

## The Risks of False Positives

High false-positive rates are concerning. For example, in an experiment, Irish police received over 4,000 images from a US child pornography organization, where 417 were family photos or pictures on the beach, leading to the unwarranted leaking of innocent images without the subjects' knowledge. These photos were improperly stored for years, raising serious concerns about who has access to our photos if E2EE is abandoned.

## Inequality between Person and Company

If E2EE is relinquished, the balance of power between individuals and companies becomes unequal. For instance, what WhatsApp does with your data on its servers remains unknown, but at least currently, E2EE is in place. Losing E2EE means our messages could be decrypted on servers, accessible to all company employees, without our knowledge.

## Pre-E2EE Crime and Alternative Solutions

Some point out that child pornography and other types of terrorism existed before E2EE, and their rates haven't significantly changed since its advent. Dutch references indicate that convictions in Dutch courts for criminals relying on E2EE are as successful as those not using E2EE. Legitimate warrants allow judicial authorities to collect evidence from suspects' phone records. Accessing chat records might help case progress but isn't necessary. True criminals likely employ various methods to evade current government surveillance, so these measures may only impact regular users, not effectively combating criminals.

# What's the Future?

First, the EU is promoting electronic IDs, so some platforms could require identity binding, allowing, with parental consent, monitoring of children's frequent chats with strangers. This still might raise privacy and security concerns. Secondly, perhaps server-side code could be open-sourced, allowing the public to know what code servers are executing. This might complicate server authority control, suggesting it might be better overseen by public organizations or government bodies. Thirdly, governments could invest in other areas, like China's extensive public area surveillance cameras, quickly locating criminal activity and securing evidence. This is clearly a more effective and less privacy-invasive method than banning E2EE. There are other ways to combat crime without completely prohibiting E2EE.

# Questions

## What about the other types of data access government requires? Why don't you mention them today?

- To answer the first question, topics like E2EE and other encryption and privacy protections are important to everyone. Additionally, I'm aware of issues like identity leaks in China, including hotel booking leaks, courier information, and other residential data. These need to be further addressed by authorities without affecting social stability, balancing convenience and safety.

## 2

I don't believe there are other means currently to monitor patterns in E2EE without accessing its actual content. Due to the nature of E2EE, we might only break through these encryptions with increased computational power in the distant future.

## 3

I view this as a global issue, not limited to any single country. Clearly, both developed and developing countries are exploring privacy protection. This calls for international organizations, including the UN, to set a new standard, balancing privacy and security to prevent additional restrictions on freedom of speech by specific countries.
