## Intro
People nowadays are experiencing fast developing period with plenty of innovations and technologies, network security is becoming the most important part of ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, which are essential. As network attacks increase in both frequency and complexity, the need to enforce security protocols to protect data transmission is becoming more evident. In this scenario, TLS, as the foundation of network transmission protection, has played a crucial role.

In recent years, TLS 1.2 has been a broadly adopted standard in production environments, reflecting the requirements and challenges of contemporary network security. However, over time, the evolution of threat models and the advancement of computational capabilities have revealed numerous potential vulnerabilities and performance limitations in TLS 1.2.

Although TLS 1.2 is still considered a relatively safer model than any other previous models, these challenges led to the development of TLS 1.3. It not only set up new security standards but also enhanced efficiency and performance. A key feature of TLS 1.3 is its streamlined handshake process and the use of more complex cryptographic primitives to offer higher security and improved performance.

Despite the theoretical and practical advantages of TLS 1.3, its deployment in production remains challenging for many companies and individuals. These challenges include compatibility with existing systems, the cost and intricacy of upgrades, and the need to understand new features. For these reasons, TLS 1.2 remains prevalent, despite its recognized security limitations.

This essay will select the most influential sources, critically review their key points, and finally write a potential future dissertation topic.

### Source Choosing

There are a few factors that may influence how I choose the sources, which are the relevance to my research interests, authority and reliability, methodology, diversity and inclusion, time sensitivity, influence and reference rate, and the target and point of view. By using the above standard, I searched through websites.

During the analysis, I will investigate both the practical and theoretical aspects. Therefore, the following sources are valuable choices, and they are categorized into five parts. The first category is deployment and usage analysis, which includes 'The Era of TLS 1.3' and 'Tracking the Deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web'. The second category is protocol analysis and formal verification, which includes 'Automated Analysis and Verification of TLS 1.3: 0-RTT, Resumption, and Delayed Authentication' and 'Key Confirmation in Key Exchange A Formal Treatment and Implications for TLS 1.3'. 'A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol' is the only source doing cryptographic analysis. 'The Privacy of the TLS 1.3 Protocol' investigates the privacy aspects of TLS 1.3, focusing on the handshake and conversation recovery processes. The final category provides an overview of TLS 1.3, which gives more information about the process of creating the protocol.
## Analysis

The paper, 'The Era of TLS 1.3: Measuring Deployment and Use with Active and Passive Methods', employs active scanning and passive monitoring techniques to assess the deployment and usage of TLS 1.3 since its standardization by the IETF. It primarily focuses on the impact of cloud providers and CDNs on the rapid deployment of TLS 1.3. The research confirms that TLS indeed utilizes the functions previously mentioned. However, the deployment of TLS 1.3 appears overly concentrated, indicating that most connections are channelled through certain specific providers, suggesting a lack of widespread server distribution. This study integrates various data sources and methodologies to offer a comprehensive view of the TLS 1.3 landscape. Nonetheless, it also uncovers certain limitations. The research is regionally confined, with passive monitoring focusing primarily on North America and Australia, thereby neglecting other regions and non-English speakers. Additionally, there are gaps in data collection, such as the exclusion of data from the latest IPV6 networks and a lack of consideration for recent TLS 1.3 extensions, like certificate authority and client-side verifications. This means that the study might not fully assess the protocol's newest features and their impacts.

In 'Tracking the Deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web: A Story of Experimentation and Centralization', the paper examines TLS 1.3's usage through multiple observation points. It discusses the safer features of TLS 1.3 and emphasizes the specific participants leading the TLS 1.3 revolution, including Cloudflare. The essay's advantage lies in its coverage of multiple observation points for investigating TLS 1.3, encompassing both mobile and website data sets. It also provides a general view of how influential companies have played a role in the development of web protocols. However, its regional checkpoints are limited, including only places like Germany, Sydney, and North America. This necessitates further consideration of other areas, such as Africa, Asia, and South America. Additionally, the study is device-specific, offering data sets only from Android devices. Another drawback is its excessive focus on leading companies, including Cloudflare, Amazon, Azure, and Alibaba, which skews the protocol towards being oriented around major companies.

Although both of the mentioned studies focus on the deployment of TLS 1.3 and the influence of big companies, they differ in several ways. The first study uses a variety of methods, including both active and passive investigations, while the second study only uses passive monitoring. The first one covers a smaller area, but the second one looks at a larger area. Also, in these studies, the focus is more on IPV4, leading to less data being collected.

In 'Automated Analysis and Verification of TLS 1.3: 0-RTT, Resumption, and Delayed Authentication,' a comprehensive analysis of different handshake modes, 0-RTT, conversation recovery, and delayed client-side authentication schema is provided. This study utilizes the Tamarin tool to simulate and analyze various handshake modes, including ECDHE, PSK, PSK-DHE, and 0-RTT. The analysis not only verifies standard targets in the key exchange but also considers client-side authentication modes and conversation recovery, which were not mentioned in previous articles. It introduces new security standards by encrypting more handshake data, re-evaluating handshake contents, reducing handshake delays, and updating the protection of record updates. It discovered a potential method for analysis, where an attacker can impersonate a regular client during the PSK key exchange process, highlighting the importance of binding in TLS 1.3's handshake. Future work will aim to simplify the testing model for new features of TLS. The advantage of this article is that it provides a more generalized analysis, such as client-side verification, and implements the new automated analysis tool, Tamarin, to increase efficiency, accuracy, and completeness, managing more complex protocol exchanges and high-concurrency conversations. However, due to the complexity of TLS 1.3, comprehensive analysis remains a significant challenge. The results of the analysis are limited to the modelling and tools used and may not capture all the threats in the real world. The research focus remains too concentrated on the protocol and does not fully consider deployment in real-life scenarios.

The paper "Key Confirmation in Key Exchange: A Formal Treatment and Implications for TLS 1.3" gives a formal strict design for key exchange. The core of this work is to define and analyze two forms of key confirmation. The core of this work is to analyze two forms, full key confirmation and almost full key confirmation and apply them to analyze the TLS 1.3 protocol. There is a key principle which is that the key confirmation is to ensure one of them accepts the key during key exchange protocol, and another also has the same entity of the same key. The research method is to consider the asymmetry of key exchange and applies detailed analysis. The key discovery is that the protocol can confirm key confirmation even when ignoring the finished message. It enhanced the conversation hash principle and the online signature in the security protection area. From an innovation point of view, this paper first strictly defines the key confirmation principle and provides a new view for understanding and analyzing TLS 1.3. However, the analysis relies too much on theoretical models. It is not possible to understand how this will work in real life. From a practical point of view, the current analysis shows the application of key confirmation in the real protocol design and provides directions for the current and future protocols. From a theoretical and practical bridge point of view, the efficacy and necessity of key validation remain a topic of debate within the security community, potentially impacting its practical application in protocol design. For my future designation, it can inspire me about the key exchange protocol's safety features investigation, especially when considering resistance to advanced attacks and future security challenges.

In two papers studying TLS 1.3, "Automated Analysis and Verification of TLS 1.3: 0-RTT, Resumption and Delayed Authentication "and" Key Confirmation in Key Exchange: A Formal Treatment and Implications for TLS 1.3 ", the main differences are in their research focus and methodology. The first article uses the Tamarin tool for automated analysis, focusing on different handshake modes (such as ECDHE, PSK, PSK-DHE, and 0-RTT) as well as client-side validation and session recovery. This paper not only validates the standard goals of key exchange but also takes into account client-side authentication and session recovery not mentioned in previous articles, introducing new standards to improve security by encrypting more handshake data. However, due to the complexity of TLS 1.3, its full analysis remains a challenge, and the results are limited by the models and tools used. In the second paper, the key confirmation is strictly formalized, and the two forms of complete key confirmation and almost complete key confirmation are analyzed, and they are applied to the analysis of the TLS 1.3 protocol. The innovation of this paper lies in the strict definition of the key confirmation principle for the first time, but the analysis relies too much on the theoretical model, and the feasibility of practical application is not clear. It explores the application of key validation in real protocol design and provides directions for current and future protocol design.

The paper titled "A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol," provides a summary of multiple articles. Its main focus is on examining the handshake process through cryptographic analysis, especially concerning Full 1-RTT, PSK, 0-RTT, and PSK-(EC)DHE, including its optional 0-RTT variant. It demonstrates that the design of TLS 1.3 adheres to solid cryptographic principles, particularly highlighting the distinctiveness and separation of keys. The study also examines signatures and hashing in the security key allocation process and offers a precise account of the 0-RTT replay attack issue. The advantage of the paper is that it facilitates both theories and practices in the argument, and continues to balance it in the evidence to provide security testification and the parameter choosing's influence on actual attack phenomenon. It provides an investigation target in the future, which is post-quantum key exchange. However, this research has its limitations. It lacks comprehensive coverage of the TLS 1.3 protocol, such as various cryptographic algorithms, signature schemes, Diffie-Hellman groups, and authenticated encryption schemes. It fails to ascertain security during the negotiation phase and does not account for the reuse of different algorithm combinations.

In Return of Version Downgrade Attack in the Era of TLS 1.3, it investigates downgrade attacks, which are attacks that force the conversation to use a low, not secure TLS version. It checks five main operating systems and ten main web browsers to test the vulnerabilities during the TLS implementation. It finally leads to the conclusion that there are vulnerabilities. The article has very detailed evidence based on all mainly used operating systems and web browsers, which increased the universality of the research. The article has original observations, it provides the first taxonomy of version downgrade, which is a meaningful step for real-world protection mechanisms. The author reported the related question to the influenced company and took responsibility as a report writer. However, it does not fully consider TLS's variety. It is a lack of server-side investigations. It also should mention the privacy issue during the process of reporting issues to the companies.

In the article on the Privacy of the TLS 1.3 Protocol, the focus is on investigating the privacy aspects of TLS 1.3. It primarily discusses the protocol's privacy protection throughout the handshake and conversation recovery processes. The article highly commends the design of TLS 1.3, highlighting improvements such as updated algorithms and earlier message encryption to enhance security and privacy. The investigation employs a privacy model to analyze privacy protection under various scenarios, including policies for AEAD and HKDF, with a special focus on the conversation recovery scheme. The strength of this publication lies in its robust argumentation. It utilizes a game-based theoretical method, a widely recognized approach in cryptography research, to define and demonstrate the privacy protection of TLS 1.3. This methodology ensures that the investigation is both systematic and thorough. The article leverages mathematical and logical evidence, providing a strong theoretical foundation for evaluating TLS 1.3's features. Furthermore, it transparently acknowledges its limitations, specifically its narrow focus on selected scenarios, lending a balanced perspective to its conclusions. However, some areas require further improvement. The article predominantly concentrates on theoretical analysis and overlooks practical considerations regarding the deployment and widespread usage of TLS 1.3.

The Introduction to the Special Issue on TLS 1.3, part of the Journal of Cryptology, outlines the development process of TLS 1.3, analyses its security levels, and examines the challenges and opportunities in deploying it in real-world production environments. Moreover, it provides another historical view. This introduction provides an overview of TLS 1.3, highlighting its collaboration with academia and the use of formal models to ensure a high-security standard before publication. It provides a comprehensive, in-depth, forward-looking, and multi-perspective review of TLS1.3, covering security, efficiency, and real-world deployment. The in-depth feature here is to provide insights on how to balance security and efficiency. The forward-looking is that it shows that TLS standards will continue to evolve. However, it limits itself to TLS 1.3, which should have a broader view if this is a publication in a well-known journal. The massive deployment may face other challenges and limitations, which are not fully discussed in the essay.

## Future Investigation
Through the critical analysis conducted earlier, I have developed three future work plans.

The first plan is to conduct a comprehensive deployment analysis of TLS 1.3 in a more diverse geographical region than those previously studied in "The Era of TLS 1.3" and "Tracking the Deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web". The focus will be on factors such as regional adoption rates, compatibility challenges, and performance metrics in these environments. This also aligns with my interests. My preliminary internet research indicates that many rapidly developing countries, including China and India, are still implementing websites with outdated protocols like RC4. Therefore, conducting research in these countries' networks could be meaningful. The research will utilize both active scanning and passive monitoring to gather data, as mentioned in the articles. We can analyze data from a wide range of network providers, focusing more on local adoption challenges and smaller ISPs. This dissertation topic is expected to enhance understanding of region-specific challenges.

Additionally, the second plan involves developing a more advanced cryptographic analysis of TLS 1.3, with a greater emphasis on Quantum-Resistant algorithms. Building on the foundations of "A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol", the new study will extend the analysis to include emerging threats from quantum computing. We will conduct a cryptographic analysis of TLS 1.3's current algorithms to assess their resilience against potential threats. Additionally, we should evaluate the performance and compatibility of implementing these algorithms, such as their encrypting efficiency. Then, we can simulate quantum attack scenarios to assess the resilience of TLS 1.3 and propose quantum-resistant modifications. This research will largely be based on previous studies.
