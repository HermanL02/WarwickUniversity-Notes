Intro
In the midst of the digital revolution, network security has emerged as a crucial factor in ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. As network attacks grow in both frequency and complexity, the importance of enforcing security protocols to make data transmission safer has become increasingly apparent. In this context, TLS, serving as the cornerstone of network transmission protection, has played a pivotal role. In this section, I will explain the background behind my choice of this topic, the rationale for selecting my reference materials, and the motivation driving my future work.
