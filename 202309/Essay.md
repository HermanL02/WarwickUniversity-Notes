## Intro
In the midst of the digital revolution, network security is becoming a critical part for ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. As network attacks increase in both frequency and complexity, the need to enforce security protocols to safeguard data transmission is becoming more evident. In this scenario, TLS, as the foundation of network transmission protection, has played a crucial role.

In recent years, TLS 1.2 is a broadly adopted standard in production environments, reflecting the requirements and challenges of the contemporary network security landscape. However, over time, the evolution of threat models and the advancement of computational capabilities have revealed numerous potential vulnerabilities and performance limitations in TLS 1.2. Although TLS 1.2 is still considered as a relatively safe model than any other previous models, these challenges led to the development of TLS 1.3. It not only set up new security standards but also enhanced efficiency and performance. A key feature of TLS 1.3 is its streamlined handshake process and the use of more complex cryptographic primitives to offer higher security and improved performance.

Despite the theoretical and practical advantages of TLS 1.3, its deployment in production remains challenging for many companies and individuals. These challenges include compatibility with existing systems, the cost and intricacy of upgrades, and the need for understanding new features. For these reasons, TLS 1.2 remains prevalent, despite its recognized security limitations.

This essay will select the most influential sources, critically review their key points and finally write a potential future dissertation topic. 

### Source Choosing
There are a few factors that may influence how I choose the sources, which are the relativity with my research interest, the authority and the reliability, methodology, diversity and inclusion, time sensitivity, influential and reference rate, and the target and point of view. By using the above standard, I searched through many websites, 

During the analyse, I will both investigate the practical part and the theoretical part. Therefore, the following sources are valuable to choose, and they are categorized to three parts. One is deployment and usage analysis, which includes The Era of TLS 1.3 and Tracking the deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web. The second part is protocol analysis and formal verification, which includes Automated Analysis and Verification of TLS 1.3: 0-RTT, Resumption, and Delayed Authentication 

cryptographic analysis, which is A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol. 



## Analysis

The paper, "The Era of TLS 1.3: Measuring Deployment and Use with Active and Passive Methods," employs active scanning and passive monitoring techniques to assess the deployment and usage of TLS 1.3 since its standardization by the IETF. It primarily focuses on the impact of cloud providers and CDNs on the rapid deployment of TLS 1.3.Their research confirms that TLS indeed utilizes the functions previously mentioned. However, the deployment of TLS 1.3 appears overly concentrated, indicating that most connections are channelled through certain specific providers, suggesting a lack of widespread server distribution. This study integrates various data sources and methodologies to offer a comprehensive view of the TLS 1.3 landscape. Nonetheless, it also uncovers certain limitations. The research is regionally confined, with passive monitoring focusing on North America and Australia, neglecting other regions and non-English speakers. Additionally, there are gaps in data collection, such as the exclusion of data from the latest IPV6 networks and a lack of consideration for recent TLS 1.3 extensions like certificate authority and client-side verifications. This means it might not fully assess the protocol's newest features and impacts.

In the paper titled "A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol," provides a summary of multiple articles. Its mainly focus is on examining the handshake process through cryptographic analysis, especially concerning Full 1-RTT, PSK, 0-RTT, and PSK-(EC)DHE, including its optional 0-RTT variant. It demonstrates that the design of TLS 1.3 adheres to solid cryptographic principles, particularly highlighting the distinctiveness and separation of keys. The study also examines signatures and hashing in the security key allocation process and offers a precise account of the 0-RTT replay attack issue. The advantage of the paper is that it facilitates both theories and practices in the argument, and continues to balance it in the evidence to provide security testification and the parameter choosing's influence on actual attack phenomenon. It provides investigation target in the future, which is post quantum key exchange. However, this research has its limitations. It lacks comprehensive coverage of the TLS 1.3 protocol, such as various cryptographic algorithms, signature schemes, Diffie-Hellman groups, and authenticated encryption schemes. It fails to ascertain security during the negotiation phase and does not account for the reuse of different algorithm combinations. 

In Tracking the deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web: A story of experimentation and centralization, it testifies the TLS's usage through multiple observation points. It covers the safer features of TLS 1.3 and emphasizes the specific participator that leads the TLS 1.3 revolution including Cloudflare. The advantage of this essay is that it covers multiple observation points to investigate TLS 1.3, including the mobile and website data sets. It also gives a general view about how influential leading companies played a role in web protocol's development. However, it only has the limited region check points, such as Germany, Sydney, North America. It requires further consideration in other areas, for example Africa, Asia, and South America. It is also device specific, which means it only offered android data sets. Another drawback is that it concentrate too much on leading companies, including Cloudflare, Amazon, Azure and Alibaba, which makes this protocol becomes a mega companies oriented protocol. 

In Return of Version Downgrade Attack in the Era of TLS 1.3, it investigates the downgrade attacks, which is an attack that attacker force the conversation to use low, not secure TLS version. It checks five main operating systems and ten main web browsers to test the vulnerabilities during the TLS implementation. It finally induct to conclusion that there is vulnerabilities. The article has a very detailed evidence based on all mainly used operating systems and web browsers, it increased the universality of the research. The article has original observations, it provides the first taxonomy of version downgrade, which is a meaningful step for real world protection mechanism. The author reported the related question to the influenced company and takes the responsibility as a report writer. However, it does not fully consider TLS's variety. It is lack of server side investigations. It also should mention the privacy issue during the process to report issues to the companies. 

In Automated Analysis and Verification of TLS 1.3: 0-RTT, Resumption and Delayed Authentication, it provides a full analyse of different handshake modes, 0-RTT, conversation recovery and delayed client-side authentication schema. This essay is to use Tamarin tool, to examine different handshake modes, including ECDHE, PSK, PSK-DHE and 0-RTT, to mock and analyse. The analysis does not only verified a standard target on the key exchange. It also considered client-side authentication mode and conversation recovery, which is not mentioned in the previous articles. It introduces the new security standard by encrypting more handshake data, re-evaluate handshake contents, reduce handshake delays and update the protection of record update. It discovered a potential way for analyse, which is the attacker can  counterfeit regular client during the PSK key exchange process. It makes the importance of making bind in TLS 1.3's handshake. The future work they will do is to simplify the testing model for new versions of TLS's features. The advantage of this article is provided a more generalized analyzation, such as client side verification. It also implemented the new automated analyzation tool, Tamarin, to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and complete, to manage more complex protocol exchange and high concurrence conversations. However, due to the complexity of TLS 1.3, the comprehensive analysis remains to be a big challenge. The result of the analyzation is limited to the modelling and tools. It may not be able to capture all the threatens in the real world. The research point is still too concentrated on the protocol. It does not fully consider the deploy in real life. 

In the article on the Privacy of the TLS 1.3 Protocol, the focus is on investigating the privacy aspects of TLS 1.3. It primarily discusses the protocol's privacy protection throughout the handshake and conversation recovery processes. The article highly commends the design of TLS 1.3, highlighting improvements such as updated algorithms and earlier message encryption to enhance security and privacy. The investigation employs a privacy model to analyse privacy protection under various scenarios, including policies for AEAD and HKDF, with a special focus on the conversation recovery scheme.The strength of this publication lies in its robust argumentation. It utilizes a game-based theoretical method, a widely recognized approach in cryptography research, to define and demonstrate the privacy protection of TLS 1.3. This methodology ensures that the investigation is both systematic and thorough. The article leverages mathematical and logical evidence, providing a strong theoretical foundation for evaluating TLS 1.3's features. Furthermore, it transparently acknowledges its limitations, specifically its narrow focus on selected scenarios, lending a balanced perspective to its conclusions.However, there are areas that require further improvement. The article predominantly concentrates on theoretical analysis and overlooks practical considerations regarding the deployment and widespread usage of TLS 1.3.

In the Introduction to the Special Issue on TLS 1.3, part of the Journal of Cryptology, it outlines the development process of TLS 1.3, analyses its security levels, and examines the challenges and opportunities in deploying it in real-world production environments. Moreover, it provides another historical view. This introduction provides an overview of TLS 1.3, highlighting its collaboration with academia and the use of formal models to ensure a high security standard before publication. It provides a comprehensive, in-depth, and forward-looking, and a multi-perspective review of TLS1.3, covering security, efficiency, and real-world deployment. The in-depth feature here is to provide the insights on how to balance security and efficiency. The forward looking is that it shows that TLS standards will continue to evolve. However, it limits itself in TLS 1.3, which should have a broader view if this is a publication on a well known journal. The massive deployment may face other challenges and limitations, which are not fully discussed in the essay. 

The paper "Key Confirmation in Key Exchange: A Formal Treatment and Implications for TLS 1.3" gives formal strict design for key exchange. The core of this work is for define and analyse two forms of key confirmation. The core of this work is to analyse two forms, full key confirmation and almost full key confirmation, and applies them to analyse TLS 1.3 protocol. There is a key principle which is that the key confirmation is to ensure one of them accept the key during key exchange protocol, and another also have the same entity of the same key. The research method is to consider the asymmetry of key exchange and applies detailed analysis. The key discovery is that the protocol can confirm key confirmation even when ignore the finished message. It enhanced the conversation hash principle and the online signature in the security protection area. From a innovation point of view, this paper first strictly define the key confirmation principle, and provide a new view for understand and analyse TLS 1.3. However, the analysis relies to much on theoretical models. It is not possible to understand how this will work in the real life. From a practical point of view, through the current analysis, it shows the application of key confirmation in the real protocol design, and provide directions for the current and future protocols. From a theoretical and practical's bridge point of view, the efficacy and necessity of key validation remain a topic of debate within the security community, potentially impacting its practical application in protocol design. For my future designation, it can inspire me about the key exchange protocol's safety features investigation, especially when considering resistance to advanced attacks and future security challenges.
