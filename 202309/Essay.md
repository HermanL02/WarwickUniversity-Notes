Intro
During the digital revolution, network security is becoming the key for data integrity, confidentiality and availability. As the frequency and complexity of network attacks increasing significantly, it is gradually becoming important to enforce the security protocol to protect the data transmission. In this context, TLS, as the base stone of protecting network transmission, played an important role. In this part, I am going to explain the background of why I selecting this topic, the reason why I choose the reference books, and the motivation of my future works.
