## Intro
In the midst of the digital revolution, network security is becoming a critical part for ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. As network attacks increase in both frequency and complexity, the need to enforce security protocols to safeguard data transmission is becoming more evident. In this scenario, TLS, as the foundation of network transmission protection, has played a crucial role.

In recent years, TLS 1.2 is a broadly adopted standard in production environments, reflecting the requirements and challenges of the contemporary network security landscape. However, over time, the evolution of threat models and the advancement of computational capabilities have revealed numerous potential vulnerabilities and performance limitations in TLS 1.2. Although TLS 1.2 is still considered as a relatively safe model than any other previous models, these challenges led to the development of TLS 1.3. It not only set up new security standards but also enhanced efficiency and performance. A key feature of TLS 1.3 is its streamlined handshake process and the use of more complex cryptographic primitives to offer higher security and improved performance.

Despite the theoretical and practical advantages of TLS 1.3, its deployment in production remains challenging for many companies and individuals. These challenges include compatibility with existing systems, the cost and intricacy of upgrades, and the need for understanding new features. For these reasons, TLS 1.2 remains prevalent, despite its recognized security limitations.

This essay will select the most influential sources, critically review their key points and finally write a potential future dissertation topic.

## Analysis

In the Introduction to the Special Issue on TLS 1.3, part of the Journal of Cryptology, it outlines the development process of TLS 1.3, analyzes its security levels, and examines the challenges and opportunities in deploying it in real-world production environments. This introduction provides an overview of TLS 1.3, highlighting its collaboration with academia and the use of formal models to ensure a high security standard before publication.

The paper, "The Era of TLS 1.3: Measuring Deployment and Use with Active and Passive Methods," employs active scanning and passive monitoring techniques to assess the deployment and usage of TLS 1.3 since its standardization by the IETF. It primarily focuses on the impact of cloud providers and CDNs on the rapid deployment of TLS 1.3.Their research confirms that TLS indeed utilizes the functions previously mentioned. However, the deployment of TLS 1.3 appears overly concentrated, indicating that most connections are channelled through certain specific providers, suggesting a lack of widespread server distribution. This study integrates various data sources and methodologies to offer a comprehensive view of the TLS 1.3 landscape. Nonetheless, it also uncovers certain limitations. The research is regionally confined, with passive monitoring focusing on North America and Australia, neglecting other regions and non-English speakers. Additionally, there are gaps in data collection, such as the exclusion of data from the latest IPV6 networks and a lack of consideration for recent TLS 1.3 extensions like certificate authority and client-side verifications. This means it might not fully assess the protocol's newest features and impacts.

In the paper titled "A Cryptographic Analysis of the TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol," provides a summary of multiple articles. Its mainly focus is on examining the handshake process through cryptographic analysis, especially concerning Full 1-RTT, PSK, 0-RTT, and PSK-(EC)DHE, including its optional 0-RTT variant. It demonstrates that the design of TLS 1.3 adheres to solid cryptographic principles, particularly highlighting the distinctiveness and separation of keys. The study also examines signatures and hashing in the security key allocation process and offers a precise account of the 0-RTT replay attack issue. The advantage of the paper is that it facilitates both theories and practices in the argument, and continues to balance it in the evidence to provide security testification and the parameter choosing's influence on actual attack phenomenon. It provides investigation target in the future, which is post quantum key exchange. However, this research has its limitations. It lacks comprehensive coverage of the TLS 1.3 protocol, such as various cryptographic algorithms, signature schemes, Diffie-Hellman groups, and authenticated encryption schemes. It fails to ascertain security during the negotiation phase and does not account for the reuse of different algorithm combinations. 

In the article on the Privacy of the TLS 1.3 Protocol, the focus is on investigating the privacy aspects of TLS 1.3. It primarily discusses the protocol's privacy protection throughout the handshake and conversation recovery processes. The article highly commends the design of TLS 1.3, highlighting improvements such as updated algorithms and earlier message encryption to enhance security and privacy. The investigation employs a privacy model to analyse privacy protection under various scenarios, including policies for AEAD and HKDF, with a special focus on the conversation recovery scheme.The strength of this publication lies in its robust argumentation. It utilizes a game-based theoretical method, a widely recognized approach in cryptography research, to define and demonstrate the privacy protection of TLS 1.3. This methodology ensures that the investigation is both systematic and thorough. The article leverages mathematical and logical evidence, providing a strong theoretical foundation for evaluating TLS 1.3's features. Furthermore, it transparently acknowledges its limitations, specifically its narrow focus on selected scenarios, lending a balanced perspective to its conclusions.However, there are areas that require further improvement. The article predominantly concentrates on theoretical analysis and overlooks practical considerations regarding the deployment and widespread usage of TLS 1.3.

In Tracking the deployment of TLS 1.3 on the Web: A story of experimentation and centralization, it testifies the TLS's usage through multiple observation points. It covers the safer features of TLS 1.3 and emphasizes the specific participator that leads the TLS 1.3 revolution including Cloudflare. The advantage of this essay is that it covers multiple observation points to investigate TLS 1.3, including the mobile and website data sets. It also gives a general view about how influential leading companies played a role in web protocol's development. However, it only has the limited region check points, such as Germany, Sydney, North America. It requires further consideration in other areas, for example Africa, Asia It is also device specific, which means it only offered android data sets. Another drawback is that it concentrate too much on leading companies, which makes this protocol becomes a mega companies oriented protocol.
