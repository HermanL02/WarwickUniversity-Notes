# Question 1 
## 1.1 Explanation
I have created a python file containing the required lines code. 
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *
def print_pkt(pkt):
    pkt.show()
pkt = sniff(iface='br-88c7c3ba0526', filter='icmp', prn=print_pkt)

```
It can capture the bridges information. Then, we we uses the container to ping the corresponding server, the information will be retrieved by the python program. 
### Results
Command Line of running Python file:

## 1.2 Explanation
Through letting the wire shark monitoring the bridge of the container, it can access all the ICMP packets the container send and receive. 

### Results
Wireshark:

## 1.3 Explanation
By using the tcpdump, we can set the source as 10.9.0.5. Then, we can capture all the packets that container transfers. 
### Result
Command Line of running tcpdump:

# Question 2
## Explanation
I modified the source as a not existed source, which is 123.123.123.123. Then, when I send the spoofed packet back to the container, it can be shown on the Wireshark, that there is a ICMP send packet from 123.123.123.123 to 10.9.0.5, and also a reply packet. 
## Result

# Question 3
## Explanation
The give Python program imports the Scapy lib and manage every sniffed packet pkt, to check if it is ICMP echo request. If so, it sends a spoofed ICMP echo response by exchange  the source address and the destination address. 
In this experiment, I changed the iface to the designated bridge container. 
When the container sending the icmp packets, it would be captured by the program. 
## Result
Command line:

# Question 4
## Question 4.1
In the sniffing and then spoofing experiment in the lab, why can you get the echo reply from 1.2.3.4 which does not exist on the Internet? 
Answer: When the container send the ICMP request, the network stack originally should send the packet to the designated IP address. However, during this process, the packet is captured by the Python script. Whatever the target IP address is, the program can send the spoofed response. 
## Question 4.2
In the above experiment, why canâ€™t you get the echo reply from 10.9.0.99?
Answer: For ARP, it is used when finding the data link level MAC address related to the network level IP address. When the host needs to connect another IP address that is within the current local network. It will send a ARP
