# Introduction
Good morning, professors. I am really glad to have a chance to bring you my dissertation project, the WeChat End-to-End Encryption Tool, which I want to call it, the Libre Chat. 
# Motivation
## WeChat Market Place
According to the latest data of Chinese instant message apps, WeChat ranked the top, which has over 1 billion daily active users. The second one is QQ, which has over 300 million daily active users. It is also a Tencent product. The third one would be Ding Talk app, which has less than 100 million, and it is more likely to be a Slack type organizational and administration app. We may observe that WeChat has a dominant role in China.

Through the searching on GitHub, I observed that there is a thinking about WeChat E2EE implementation. However, WeChat does not support the Web version any more, it will redirect most users to use the Desktop version.  ![[Pasted image 20240414170049.png]]
