### 1.1 
This does not comply the hashing definitions. 
First, hashing needs to have an operation mode which needs to have a structure to divide the hash to the blocks. However, there is no function to do that. 
Second, the hashing needs to have a confusion and diffusion. The confusion means every input needs to change multiple times. The diffusion means every input needs to have a different output. 
Third, the hashing needs to have a compression. 

However, the above function does not meet the three criteria. 
### 1.2
No, the hash is not secure. 
1. In this scenario, it does not mention any TLS/SSL encryption here, which may cause a severe issue that the man in the middle can intercept the hash without knowing the hash, which is a man in the middle attack and reply attack. 
2. The hash does not contain any salt rounds, which means it might have the dictionary attacks. 
### 1.3 
A. ECB encoding means it encrypts each block individually. 
B. The high resolution photo might cause different pixels to be merged together. Although the pattern cannot be visually seen, it doesn't mean that it does not exist. 

### 1.4 
At OFB mode, the C_i is generated from `P_i nor K_i `, the same iv would generate the same key pair. 
We know 1101 0101 nor K = 0111 1001 
K = 10101100
We know 1100 1010 nor K = 1010 0100
K = 01101110

Therefore, Charlie can decrypt any first two blocks word in the future. 
### 2.1 
a
A=g^a mod p
B=g^b mod p
交换 A B
A的公钥 s = B^a mod p
B的公钥 s = A^b mod p
b
The man in the middle can generate a secret key between Alice and the attacker, and can generate a secret key between Bob and the attacker. Then although Alice and Bob believes that they are talking to each other with there common public key, they are indeed using the public key with the middle man to talk to each other. 
c
We can use hash to do that. Generally hash could provide if their public key is the same. 


### 2.2
RSA: n = 33; fi(n) = 20; e = 3
ed = 1mod fi(n)
3d = 21 d = 7

### 3.1
A. We can do a SQL injection. Fill in `190"; # `. 
B. Make OR 1=1; 
### 3.2
A. No, should be on Server side
B. Pre defined search statement; User input will be always used as user input; 
### 3.3
1. Didn't use prepared statements
2. No salt, and hash compare; might be dictionary attack
