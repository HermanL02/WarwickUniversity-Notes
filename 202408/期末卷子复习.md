## Question 1
### 1.1 
This does not comply the hashing definitions. 
First, hashing needs to have an operation mode which needs to have a structure to divide the hash to the blocks. However, there is no function to do that. 
Second, the hashing needs to have a confusion and diffusion. The confusion means every input needs to change multiple times. The diffusion means every input needs to have a different output. 
Third, the hashing needs to have a compression. 

However, the above function does not meet the three criteria. 
### 1.2
No, the hash is not secure. 
1. In this scenario, it does not mention any TLS/SSL encryption here, which may cause a severe issue that the man in the middle can intercept the hash without knowing the hash, which is a man in the middle attack and reply attack. 
2. The hash does not contain any salt rounds, which means it might have the dictionary attacks. 
### 1.3 
A. ECB encoding means it encrypts each block individually. 
B. The high resolution photo might
