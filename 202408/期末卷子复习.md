### 1.1 
This does not comply the hashing definitions. 
First, hashing needs to have an operation mode which needs to have a structure to divide the hash to the blocks. However, there is no function to do that. 
Second, the hashing needs to have a confusion and diffusion. The confusion means every input needs to change multiple times. The diffusion means every input needs to have a different output. 
Third, the hashing needs to have a compression. 

However, the above function does not meet the three criteria. 
### 1.2
No, the hash is not secure. 
1. In this scenario, it does not mention any TLS/SSL encryption here, which may cause a severe issue that the man in the middle can intercept the hash without knowing the hash, which is a man in the middle attack and reply attack. 
2. The hash does not contain any salt rounds, which means it might have the dictionary attacks. 
### 1.3 
A. ECB encoding means it encrypts each block individually. 
B. The high resolution photo might cause different pixels to be merged together. Although the pattern cannot be visually seen, it doesn't mean that it does not exist. 

### 1.4 
At OFB mode, the C_i is generated from `P_i nor K_i `, the same iv would generate the same key pair. 
We know 1101 0101 nor K = 0111 1001 
K = 10101100
We know 1100 1010 nor K = 1010 0100
K = 01101110

Therefore, Charlie can decrypt any first two blocks word in the future. 
### 2.1 
a
A=g^a mod p
B=g^b mod p
交换 A B
A的公钥 s = B^a mod p
B的公钥 s = A^b mod p
b
The man in the middle can generate a secret key between Alice and the attacker, and can generate a secret key between Bob and the attacker. Then although Alice and Bob believes that they are talking to each other with there common public key, they are indeed using the public key with the middle man to talk to each other. 
c
We can use hash to do that. Generally hash could provide if their public key is the same. 


### 2.2
RSA: n = 33; fi(n) = 20; e = 3
ed = 1mod fi(n)
3d = 21 d = 7

### 3.1
A. We can do a SQL injection. Fill in `190"; # `. 
B. Make OR 1=1; 
### 3.2
A. No, should be on Server side
B. Pre defined search statement; User input will be always used as user input; 
### 3.3
1. Didn't use prepared statements
2. No salt, and hash compare; might be dictionary attack
### 3.4
No translate; No verification; No parameterized query/ prepared statements; 
### 4.1 
1. Because SYN flood causes the server to have too many open connections. So the server cannot retrieve the latest request. 
2. The TCP comes from different source cause it is hard to distinguish and defend. 
3. Receiving SYN-ACK may cause the users send RST package. 
4. TCP header is required to change. Fake source IP. 
5. 使用SYN cookies, 是一个hash来不需要继续保持open connection
### 4.2
1. 一个是伪装自己是DNS服务器来给用户返回请求，一种是当本地dns服务器向云端DNS请求时，通过大量虚假请求覆盖
2. 因为本地只需要骗user的就可以，远程DNS需要覆盖local DNS的请求，猜测识别码
3. Kaminsky通过伪造大量的DNS请求和回复来让Local DNS Server存储错误的DNS记录，返回攻击者控制的服务器的IP地址

### 1.1 

The key size of the substitution cipher is 26!. The substitution cipher can be broken through the index of coincidence or the frequency of the characters. 

### 1.2 
Vignere Cipher is to move the chars to a direction. We would know in this case the cipher length is shorter than 8 and longer than 3, because the repeating of KIO. 

### 1.3
正常是0.038，对于每个词还有不同的频率，我们可以通过不同长度词的相合是否等于0.065来判断是否是key。
### 1.4
