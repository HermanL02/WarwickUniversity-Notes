## Question 1
### 1.1 
This does not comply the hashing definitions. 
First, hashing needs to have an operation mode which needs to have a structure to divide the hash to the blocks. However, there is no function to do that. 
Second, the hashing needs to have a confusion and diffusion. The confusion means every input needs to change multiple times. The diffusion means every input needs to have a different output. 
Third, the hashing needs to have a compression. 

However, the above function does not meet the three criteria. 
### 1.2
No, the hash is not secure.
