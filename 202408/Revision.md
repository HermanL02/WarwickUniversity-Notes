# Crypto
## Four General Types of Attack
- Ciphertext-only
- Known-plaintext
- Chosen-plaintext
- Chosen-ciphertext
To store all 256-bit Keys 2264 bits

## Shannon Confusion and Diffusion

- Confusion: Obscures the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext
- Diffusion: Dissipates the redundancy of the plaintext by spreading it out over the ciphertext
