# Introduction
In today's digital era, instant messaging platforms have become integral to daily communication. To ensure the communication security, many users prefer to use the secured communication apps such as WhatsApp, which provides an end-to-end encryption feature. 

However, in People's Republic of China(PRC), these secure apps are not accessible due to the government applied internet restrictions. Instead, in the Chinese market, among all these platforms, WeChat stands out with over 1 billion daily active users, making it a dominant force in the messaging area. However, compare to the competitors on the global market, we found neither of the Chinese apps provides a End-to-End Encryption(E2EE) feature nor seen security and communication safety as their priority. 

Therefore, we want to introduce an End-to-End Encryption solution for WeChat with main focus on Windows and Android platforms, which may potentially benefits people who can only access to mainland chat applications and the people who need to keep contact with mainland friends. 
# Background and Research
## E2EE Measures from a Global Perspective
There are four properties are used to ensure the messaging is secure, which are confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. There are many encryption protocols are designed to fulfil the these properties, such as Signal protocol and the RSA protocol. Normally, iMessage, WhatsApp and Zoom provides a default E2EE or provides a E2EE option.
