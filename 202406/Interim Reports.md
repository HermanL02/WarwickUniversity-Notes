# Introduction
In today's digital era, instant messaging platforms have become integral to daily communication. To ensure the communication security, many users prefer to use the secured communication apps such as WhatsApp, which provides an end-to-end encryption feature. 

However, in People's Republic of China(PRC), these secure apps are not accessible due to the government applied internet restrictions. Instead, in the Chinese market, among all these platforms, WeChat stands out with over 1 billion daily active users, making it a dominant force in the messaging area. However, compare to the competitors on the global market, we found neither of the Chinese apps provides a E2EE feature nor seen security and communication safety as their first or top priority. 

Therefore, we want to introduce an End-to-End Encryption solution for WeChat with main focus on Windows and Android platforms, which may potentially benefits people who can only access to mainland chat applications and the people who need to keep contact with mainland friends.
